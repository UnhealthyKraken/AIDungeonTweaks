# Changelog

## 1.4.7 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Changed: AIDT navbar button refined for Chrome/Firefox: true button element, keyboard support, capture‚Äëphase handling and debounce to avoid double toggles; remains far‚Äëright in the bar.
- Fixed: Occasionally unclickable or double‚Äëtoggling navbar control in Chrome.

## 1.4.6 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Changed: Moved the AIDT button into the top navbar (next to Settings). The floating button now auto‚Äëhides on mobile to avoid covering text or the send button. The navbar control uses a distinct üß© icon.
- Fixed: Emoji/special characters no longer break parsing/formatting in the newest paragraph.
- Fixed: Say/Do rows keep their coloring/weight after erasing the following model reply.
- Fixed: Quote detection refined so heights/measurements like 5'8" or 3" aren‚Äôt treated as dialogue.
- Fixed: Newest‚Äëparagraph speech wrapping on the overlay is more robust and avoids mutation loops/freezes.

## 1.4.5 ‚Äì 2025-09-07

- Fixed: Quoted speech misclassified as Internal Monologue when preceded by a trailing *; tightened IM detection to single-line and boundary-aware.
- Fixed: Stray IM placeholder producing empty golden quotes (‚Äú‚Äù); ignore empty/whitespace IM captures.
