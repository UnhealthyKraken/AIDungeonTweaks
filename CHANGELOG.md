# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.4.8.3 ‚Äì 2025-09-10
- Changed: Paragraphs ‚Üí New Line now places every quote/IM on its own line and trims any leading indentation on the following narration.

## 1.4.8.2 ‚Äì 2025-09-10
- Fixed: Paragraphs setting now persists across reloads; UI no longer overwrites saved value during refresh.
- Changed: Changing Paragraphs setting keeps view pinned to the bottom of the page.
- Fixed: New Line mode refined to preserve narration and only isolate quotes/IM at paragraph boundaries (no mid‚Äësentence splits).
- Fixed: Prevent double‚Äëescaping of ampersands/entities inside quotes and IM (e.g., R&D stays R&D).
- Fixed: Short punctuated quotes like "Yes," and "Yes." are now colored as speech.

## 1.4.8.1 ‚Äì 2025-09-10
- Fixed: New Line paragraph mode now preserves narration as-is, adds a blank line before quotes/IM, and ensures exactly one newline after them. It no longer splits narration into separate sentences and no longer strips invisible spaces.
- Fixed: Double-blank lines between entries collapsed to a single blank line (handles spaces-only lines too).
- Fixed: Quotes and IM spacing unified so both use one blank line after, not two.
- Stability: Disabled risky overlay token-wrapping (reparenting) on the live split-word overlay to avoid intermittent NextJS removeChild errors and page crashes. Paragraph formatting still applies to the newest paragraph via safe overlay normalization.

## 1.4.8 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Added: Background ‚ÄúImage URL‚Äù mode (under Misc ‚Üí Background). Paste any image URL to use it as the page background. The image option is applied immediately and persists per profile.
- Added: Text Formatting ‚Üí Font ‚Üí Paragraphs setting (Default, Basic, New Line):
  - Default: leave story text as-is.
  - Basic: insert a blank line between paragraphs (keeps existing lines intact).
  - New Line: place each sentence and each quoted line on its own line with a blank line between entries. Abbreviation-aware (e.g., ‚ÄúMr.‚Äù, ‚ÄúDr.‚Äù, ‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù, ‚Äúa.m.‚Äù) and ignores ellipses, so it won‚Äôt split mid‚Äëabbreviation.
- Changed: Paragraphs option applies instantly and is reversible; switching modes re-renders the newest/visible output without a page refresh.

## 1.4.7.1 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Fixed: Compatibility on play.aidungeon.com ‚Äì navbar mount now targets the correct Menu/Settings button when duplicates exist, preserves pointer events, and pins the AIDT control at the far right.
- Changed: Separate Chrome vs Firefox handling for the navbar control (Chrome uses capture‚Äëphase pointer handlers and debounce; Firefox uses a standard click), covering both play and beta domains.

## 1.4.7 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Changed: AIDT navbar button refined for Chrome/Firefox: true button element, keyboard support, capture‚Äëphase handling and debounce to avoid double toggles; remains far‚Äëright in the bar.
- Fixed: Occasionally unclickable or double‚Äëtoggling navbar control in Chrome.

## 1.4.6 ‚Äì 2025-09-09
- Changed: Moved the AIDT button into the top navbar (next to Settings). The floating button now auto‚Äëhides on mobile to avoid covering text or the send button. The navbar control uses a distinct üß© icon.
- Fixed: Emoji/special characters no longer break parsing/formatting in the newest paragraph.
- Fixed: Say/Do rows keep their coloring/weight after erasing the following model reply.
- Fixed: Quote detection refined so heights/measurements like 5'8" or 3" aren‚Äôt treated as dialogue.
- Fixed: Newest‚Äëparagraph speech wrapping on the overlay is more robust and avoids mutation loops/freezes.

## 1.4.5 ‚Äì 2025-09-07
- Added: Italics (unquoted) style with its own Bold/Colour settings, separate from Internal Monologue.
- Added: Colour preset dropdowns for Do, Say, Main Text, Speech, Internal Monologue, and Italics.
- Added: ALL CAPS exclusions list (e.g., HQ, CEO, NASA) with instant apply; chips UI for add/remove.
- Fixed: Overlay sync with split-word layer (game-backdrop-saturate) to ensure newest paragraph reflects changes.
- Fixed: Latest paragraph targeting to prefer the newest overlay/copy elements.
- Fixed: Quoted speech misclassified as Internal Monologue when preceded by a trailing *; tightened IM detection to single-line and boundary-aware.
- Fixed: Stray IM placeholder producing empty golden quotes (‚Äú‚Äù); ignore empty/whitespace IM captures.
- Fixed: Locale strings with apostrophes (French) escaped to remove linter errors.
- Fixed: Keyword ‚ÄúCustom Color‚Ä¶‚Äù flow; color picker persists and restyles existing keyword spans immediately.
- Changed: Moved ALL CAPS exclusions UI under All Caps Effects section; updated labels to include new Italics section.
